  # Rule 3 - Keep IC and OOC Seperate

  Keep in character interactions in character, and out of character interactions out of character.

  ## Precedents

  - Don't use the OOC or LOOC chat to communicate in character, such as using it to bypass speech restrictions.
  - Using LOOC to teach someone something that can't be taught in character such as the controls of the game, is fine.
  - Don't say LOOC or OOC things in character, such as referencing the duration of a round. Stay in character.
