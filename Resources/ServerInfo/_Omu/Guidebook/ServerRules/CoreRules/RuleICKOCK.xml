# Rule 3 - Keep IC and OOC Seperate

Keep in character interactions in character, and out of character interactions out of character.

## Precedents
- Don't use the OOC or LOOC chat to communicate because you are mutet or otherwise can't communicate in character.
- Don't say LOOC or OOC things in character, such as referencing the duration of a round. Stay in character.
