  # Core Rule 1 - Don't be a dick.

  Be excellent to each other. If you enjoy trying to ruin someone else’s good time, you won’t have a place here. Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome.

  ## Precedents

  - Being excessively rude and annoying or simply 'ragebaiting' people is not allowed.
  - Any action done with the intent to upset people out of character is not allowed.
  - Thinly veiled real life slurs under the guide of 'speciesism' is not allowed. It's also boring and uncreative.
  - Spamming the chat is not allowed.
  - Joining and exiting the round in an attempt to maximize antagonist rolls is not allowed.
  - Anything else that just generally ruins or worsens the round and fun for others. Use common sense, and be nice out of character.
