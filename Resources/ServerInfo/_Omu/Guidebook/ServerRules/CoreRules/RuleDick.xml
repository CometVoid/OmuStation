  # Core Rule 1 - Don't be a dick.

  Be excellent to each other. If you enjoy trying to ruin someone else’s good time, you won’t have a place here. Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome.

  ## Precedents

  - Do not facilitate player deaths for poor IC reasoning. Distributing bombs or other similarly destructive items can leave you responsible for how they are used if not cleared with an admin first. Each unjustified kill is normally met with a 24-hour ban.
  - Breaking into staffed departments to take resources, or hoarding station supplies with little IC reasoning can be harmful to the experience of other players. Communicate first if you desire something that you do not have access to. Players may defend their workplaces from trespassers who damage or steal property with relaxed escalation.
  - Unjustified grief/tiding, minor or otherwise, or unprovoked grief targeted towards players who wronged you in previous rounds ('metagrudging') can be followed up with notes, or bans.
  - If you do something that has no benefit to you other than making others upset and adminhelp the in-game consequences, you may be banned instead.
  - Spamming any channel is not allowed unless granted explicit permission from an admin as part of a gimmick.
  - Joining and exiting the round in an attempt to maximize antagonist rolls is not allowed.
  - Anything else that just generally ruins or worsens the round and fun for others. Use common sense, and be nice out of character.
