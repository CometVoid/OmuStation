  # Rule 2 - Don't metagame

  I.e. don't use out of character knowledge in game, and any knowledge you're acting on should make sense for your character to know in character.
  ## Precedents

  - You are allowed to be in a VC together, but you are not allowed to act on information that you obtained from the vc.
  - Streaming of the server is allowed. However if there's any indication that the stream is being used to metagame, such as a player watching the stream to gain information about the round, it will be treated as metacomms and dealt with accordingly.
  - Characters are allowed to have persistent knowledge/relationships/friendships/rivalries across rounds, and remember information from previous rounds.
  - Character friendships should not be exploitative in nature or be used to gain an unfair advantage. Having an IC friendship with another player does not, for example, justify giving them all-access each round.
  - You don't know the round type. You shouldn't start hunting for a blob just because there have been no meteorites, and unless you have a good in character reason, you shouldn't be expecting antags to just show up.
